# Maintainability Code Review Guidelines
# This guideline set emphasizes architecture, organization, and long-term code health.
# Use this for projects prioritizing maintainability and reducing technical debt.

guidelines:
  # Architecture & Design
  - label: single-responsibility
    description: Functions should do one thing well. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

  - label: cyclomatic-complexity
    description: Reduce cyclomatic complexity. Break down complex conditional logic into smaller functions.

  - label: separation-of-concerns
    description: Maintain clear separation of concerns. Avoid God services or God classes that handle too many unrelated responsibilities.

  # Code Organization
  - label: logical-organization
    description: Organize code logically. Group related functionality together.

  - label: proximity
    description: Keep related code close together. Minimize the distance between definition and usage.

  - label: remove-dead-code
    description: Remove dead code, commented-out code, and unused imports. Keep the codebase clean.

  # DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - label: avoid-duplication
    description: Avoid code duplication. Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or classes.

  - label: avoid-premature-abstraction
    description: Use abstraction to eliminate duplication, but avoid premature abstraction.

  # Error Handling
  - label: handle-exceptions
    description: Do not catch exceptions unless you are handling them. Let them bubble up.

  - label: specific-exceptions
    description: Avoid bare except clauses. Catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.
