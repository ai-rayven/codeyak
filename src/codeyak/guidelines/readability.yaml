# Readability Code Review Guidelines
# This guideline set emphasizes code clarity, naming conventions, and documentation.
# Use this for projects prioritizing clear and understandable code.

guidelines:
  # Function & Method Design
  - label: function-length
    description: No long functions.

  - label: code-clarity
    description: The code must be very easy to read and understand.

  - label: no-god-classes
    description: No long functions and no God services.

  # Naming Conventions
  - label: descriptive-names
    description: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood.

  - label: intentional-names
    description: Names should reveal intent. Avoid generic names like data, info, temp, or process.

  # Documentation & Comments
  - label: self-documenting
    description: Write self-documenting code. Code should be clear enough to understand without comments.

  - label: comment-why-not-what
    description: Add comments only when necessary to explain why, not what. The code should show what it does.
