# Readability Code Review Guidelines
# This guideline set emphasizes code clarity, naming conventions, and documentation.
# Use this for projects prioritizing clear and understandable code.

guidelines:
  # Function & Method Design
  - label: function-length
    description: Keep functions short and focused. Avoid long functions and God classes/services that do too many things.

  - label: code-clarity
    description: The code must be very easy to read and understand.

  # Naming Conventions
  - label: descriptive-names
    description: Use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent. Avoid abbreviations (unless widely understood) and generic names like data, info, temp, or process.

  # Documentation & Comments
  - label: self-documenting-code
    description: Write self-documenting code that is clear without comments. When comments are needed, explain why (not what) - the code should show what it does.
