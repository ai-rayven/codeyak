# Code Quality Guidelines
# This guideline set emphasizes clean code, readability, and maintainability.
# Use this for projects prioritizing understandable, well-structured code.

guidelines:
  # Function & Class Design
  - label: single-responsibility
    description: Functions and classes should do one thing well. Keep them short, focused, and avoid God classes/services that handle too many responsibilities.

  - label: cyclomatic-complexity
    description: Reduce cyclomatic complexity. Break down complex conditional logic into smaller, focused functions.

  - label: separation-of-concerns
    description: Maintain clear separation of concerns at the architectural level. Different layers and modules should have distinct responsibilities.

  # Naming & Clarity
  - label: descriptive-names
    description: Use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent. Avoid abbreviations (unless widely understood) and generic names like data, info, temp, or process.

  - label: self-documenting-code
    description: Write self-documenting code that is clear without comments. When comments are needed, explain why (not what) - the code should show what it does.

  # Code Organization
  - label: logical-organization
    description: Organize code logically. Group related functionality together.

  - label: proximity
    description: Keep related code close together. Minimize the distance between definition and usage.

  - label: remove-dead-code
    description: Remove dead code, commented-out code, and unused imports. Keep the codebase clean.

  # DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - label: avoid-duplication
    description: Avoid code duplication. Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or classes.

  - label: avoid-premature-abstraction
    description: Use abstraction to eliminate duplication, but avoid premature abstraction.

  # Error Handling
  - label: handle-exceptions
    description: Do not catch exceptions unless you are handling them. Let them bubble up.

  - label: specific-exceptions
    description: Avoid bare except clauses. Catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.
